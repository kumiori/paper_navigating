	abstract = {Mechanics plays a key role in the evolution of the sea ice cover through its control on drift, on momentum and thermal energy exchanges between the polar oceans and the atmosphere along cracks and faults, and on ice thickness distribution through opening and ridging processes. At the local scale, a significant variability of the mechanical strength is associated with the microstructural heterogeneity of saline ice, however characterized by a small correlation length, below the ice thickness scale. Conversely, the sea ice mechanical fields (velocity, strain and stress) are characterized by long-ranged (more than 1000 km) and long-lasting (approx. few months) correlations. The associated space and time scaling laws are the signature of the brittle character of sea ice mechanics, with deformation resulting from a multi-scale accumulation of episodic fracturing and faulting events. To translate the short-range-correlated disorder on strength into long-range-correlated mechanical fields, several key ingredients are identified: long-ranged elastic interactions, slow driving conditions, a slow viscous-like relaxation of elastic stresses and a restoring/healing mechanism. These ingredients constrained the development of a new continuum mechanics modelling framework for the sea ice cover, called Maxwell-elasto-brittle. Idealized simulations without advection demonstrate that this rheological framework reproduces the main characteristics of sea ice mechanics, including anisotropy, spatial localization and intermittency, as well as the associated scaling laws.This article is part of the themed issue 'Microdynamics of ice'.},

	abstract = {The glaciers of North Greenland are hosting enough ice to raise sea level by 2.1 m, and have long considered to be stable. This part of Greenland is buttressed by the last remaining ice shelves of the ice sheet. Here, we show that since 1978, ice shelves in North Greenland have lost more than 35{\%} of their total volume, three of them collapsing completely. For the floating ice shelves that remain we observe a widespread increase in ice shelf mass losses, that are dominated by enhanced basal melting rates. Between 2000 and 2020, there was a widespread increase in basal melt rates that closely follows a rise in the ocean temperature. These glaciers are showing a direct dynamical response to ice shelf changes with retreating grounding lines and increased ice discharge. These results suggest that, under future projections of ocean thermal forcing, basal melting rates will continue to rise or remain at high level, which may have dramatic consequences for the stability of Greenlandic glaciers.},

	abstract = {From 2017 to 2020, three significant calving events took place on Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica. Ice-shelf velocities changed over this period and the calving events have been suggested as possible drivers. However, satellite observations also show significant changes in the areal extent of fracture zones, especially in the marginal areas responsible for providing lateral support to the ice shelf. Here, we conduct a model study to identify and quantify drivers of recent ice-flow changes of the Pine Island Ice Shelf. In agreement with recent studies, we find that the calving events caused significant velocity changes over the ice shelf. However, calving alone cannot explain observed velocity changes. Changes in the structural rigidity, i.e. ice damage, further significantly impacted ice flow. We suggest that ice damage evolution of the ice-shelf margins may have influenced recent calving events, and these two processes are linked.},

	abstract = {This work aims to investigate the correlation between the painting materials used by Picasso to create four artworks in Barcelona in 1917 and their actual conditions. Specifically, a range of crack types and patterns was observed in the painted layers. The paintings, kept together in Picasso's family house until they were donated to the Museu Picasso in 1970, had significant differences in their condition, even though they present several similarities in the choice of materials, technique and in their conservation history. A multi-analytical approach was adopted to characterise the painted layers by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy in the 350--2200 nm range, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The obtained results have been combined with those from a previous analytical campaign focused on the study of grounds and canvases of these four paintings and with visual examination of the cracks to establish hypotheses about the differences in degradation. This combined overview of non-invasive documentation techniques, chemical analysis and observations of the mechanical damage has provided an insight into the possible contribution each layer could have played in the damage observed in the four canvas paintings.},

@article{Bosco:2021,
	abstract = {Crack channelling in a brittle, flexural bilayer, composed of a coating adhering to a substrate of finite thickness, is addressed for the case of a uniform moisture content (or temperature) variation. The linear stress profile within the coating may lead to three different fracture mechanisms, which are a channelling crack with delamination absent, a channelling crack with delamination of finite length, and a channelling crack with delamination of unbounded extent. Failure mechanism maps illustrate the dependence of the active crack channelling mechanism, and the corresponding critical crack channelling stress, upon the stiffness mismatch between the layers and upon the ratio of interfacial toughness to coating toughness. Although the results are applicable to bilayers in a wide range of applications, the study focuses on the prediction of crack channelling in historical paintings. The significance of bending of the bilayer upon crack channelling is explored by comparing the fracture characteristics of the simply-supported, flexural bilayer with those of a rigidly supported bilayer that is constrained against bending. These two bilayer systems are representative of the different framing techniques commonly used for historical paintings, with the simply-supported bilayer reflecting a regular wooden panel that can bend freely, and the rigidly supported bilayer characterizing a wooden panel that does not bend as a result of cradle additions composed of several horizontal members and corresponding orthogonal cross-pieces. Independent of the type of framing technique applied, it is shown that crack channelling with delamination can be avoided in historical paintings when the delamination toughness exceeds the mode I toughness of the paint layer. Under these conditions paint flaking does not occur and the visual appearance of the painting is preserved. The failure maps constructed in this study provide a useful tool for museum conservators to identify acceptable indoor humidity and temperature variations such that historical paintings do not degrade by a combination of crack channelling and delamination.},

	abstract = {Crack channelling is predicted in a brittle coating-substrate system that is subjected to a moisture or temperature gradient in the thickness direction. Competing failure scenarios are identified, and are distinguished by the degree to which the coating-substrate interface delaminates, and whether this delamination is finite or unlimited in nature. Failure mechanism maps are constructed, and illustrate the sensitivity of the active crack channelling mechanism and associated channelling stress to the ratio of coating toughness to interfacial toughness, to the mismatch in elastic modulus and to the mismatch in coefficient of hygral or thermal expansion. The effect of the ratio of coating to substrate thickness upon the failure mechanism and channelling stress is also explored. Closed-form expressions for the steady-state delamination stress are derived, and are used to determine the transition value of moisture state that leads to unlimited delamination. Although the results are applicable to coating-substrate systems in a wide range of applications, the study focusses on the prediction of cracking in historical paintings due to indoor climate fluctuations, with the objective of helping museums developing strategies for the preservation of art objects. For this specific application, crack channelling with delamination needs to be avoided under all circumstances, as it may induce flaking of paint material. In historical paintings, the substrate thickness is typically more than ten times larger than the thickness of the paint layer; for such a system, the failure maps constructed from the numerical simulations indicate that paint delamination is absent if the delamination toughness is larger than approximately half of the mode I toughness of the paint layer. Further, the transition between crack channelling with and without delamination appears to be relatively insensitive to the mismatch in the elastic modulus of the substrate and paint layer. The failure maps developed in this work may provide a useful tool for museum conservators to identify the allowable indoor humidity and temperature fluctuations for which crack channelling with delamination is prevented in historical paintings.},

	abstract = {Deformation twinning is critical to understanding and predicting
               the heterogenous deformation of many important material systems,
               e.g., hexagonal metals. In this work, we report a
               Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT) based spectral phase-field method
               (PFM) model of deformation twinning and plasticity by directly
               incorporating the spectral FFT elasto-viscoplastic formulation,
               which allows two-way coupling between morphological evolution of
               deformation twinning and elastoplastic deformation. We verify the
               model by studying the twinning morphology evolution and plastic
               deformation of Mg single crystals and comparing the results with
               existing experimental measurements. We then apply the model to
               investigate heterogeneous twinning nucleation, growth and
               propagation behaviors, including twin-twin interactions, double
               twinning, and twin-grain boundary interactions. This work not
               only provides useful insights into the underlying deformation
               twinning mechanisms in hexagonal crystals but also presents an
               efficient PFM model of deformation twinning and plasticity which
               is generally applicable to modelling and predicting morphological
               evolution of deformation twinning and its effects on
               elasto-plastic responses of polycrystalline materials.},

               surface of a body and given nominal traction-rates on the

               in the boundary-value problem itself or in the postulated
               material properties, which are a generalization of those
               conventionally assumed for workhardening elastic-plastic solids.
               The solution, when it is unique, is characterized by an extremum
               principle.Stability under dead loading is also examined, and a
               criterion is proposed. This has a formal resemblance to the
               uniqueness criterion, but differs from it in a significant
               respect when the body is partly plastic, so that stability and
               uniqueness need not be parallel properties.Finally, the present,
               theorems are compared with those previously proved for
               rigid-plastic solids (Hill 1957a, b. d).},

	abstract = {Nanostructures are technological devices constructed on a
              nanometer length scale more than a thousand times thinner than a
              human hair. Due to the unique properties of matter at this scale,
              such devices offer great potential for creating novel materials
              and behaviors that can be leveraged to benefit mankind. This
              paper addresses a particular challenge involved in the design of
              nanostructures--their stochastic or apparently random response to
              external loading. This is because fundamentally the function that
              relates the energy of a nanostructure to the arrangement of its
              atoms is extremely nonconvex, with each minimum corresponding to
              a possible equilibrium state that may be visited as the system
              responds to loading. Traditional atomistic simulation techniques
              are not capable of systematically addressing this complexity.
              Instead, we construct an equilibrium map (EM) for the
              nanostructure, analogous to a phase diagram for bulk materials,
              which fully characterizes its response. Using the EM, definitive
              predictions can be made in limiting cases and the spectrum of
              responses at any desired loading rate can be obtained. The latter
              is important because standard atomistic methods are fundamentally
              limited, by computational feasibility, to simulations of loading
              rates that are many orders of magnitude faster than reality. In
              contrast, the EM-based approach makes possible the direct
              simulation of nanostructure experiments. We demonstrate the
              method's capabilities and its surprisingly complex results for
              the case of a nanoslab of nickel under compression.},

              models, emerge asymptotically from standard, linear,
              three-dimensional elasticity. We study the parametric asymptotics
              of a non-homogeneous linearly elastic bi-layer attached to a
              rigid substrate as its thickness vanishes, for varying thickness
              and stiffness ratios. By using rigorous arguments based on energy
              estimates, we provide a first rational and constructive
              justification of reduced foundation models. We establish the
              variational weak convergence of the three-dimensional elasticity
              problem to a two-dimensional one, of either a ``membrane over
              in-plane elastic foundation'', or a ``plate over transverse
              elastic foundation''. These two regimes are function of the only
              two parameters of the system, and a phase diagram synthesizes
              their domains of validity. Moreover, we derive explicit
