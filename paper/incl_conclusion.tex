\section{DISCUSSION} 

\added[id=ALB]{Capturing branch switching phenomena across stability transitions is not an automatic feature of approximate numerical methods. They rely on approximate information about the Hessian of the energy functional, as a consequence these methods do not guarantee to systematically detect transitions between local minima when stability is lost. 
Indeed, this requires a careful determination of the zero-eigenmodes that render singular the exact nonlinear Hessian, which is typically not available in general purpose first order numerical algorithms.
In practice, without such information, critical loads for equilibrium transitions become algorithm-dependant and are not consistent with closed-form solutions of the exact evolution problem.}

OUR EVIDENCE IS that certain numerical methods can introduce non-physical artifacts which should be distinguished from genuine physical phenomena. Our ongoing work, NAVIGATING LOCAL MINIMA RELYING SOLELY ON A STATEMENT OF STABILITY, aims to refine these techniques and provide more reliable algorithms for analySing irreversible evolutions in variational problems AND GAMES.

% Numerical PERTURBATIONS, which CAN arise due to the use of quasi-Newton methods and (conjugate) gradients (HENCE, NOT EXACT HESSIANS), introduce non-physical crack nucleation under GENERAL conditions.
MORE THAN Numerical PERTURBATIONS, (which CAN ALWAUS arise) IT IS THE the use of quasi-Newton methods and (conjugate) gradients IN LIEU OF EXACT HESSIANS, TO introduce non-physical crack nucleation under GENERAL conditions.

This is an important observation, highlighting that the stability of the solutionS (HERE, THE homogeneous) should be THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED. FURTHERMORE, preserved AS OBSERVABLE IF STABLE, under increasing load, assuming no nucleation should occur if only physical factors are considered, WHICH ARE ENCAPSULATED IN THE STABILITY STATEMENT OR EVOLUTION LAW.

We present two main options for discussing these CONSIDERATIONS IN VIEW OF THE importance of using accurate and robust algorithms IN REAL SCENARIOS.

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    Ignore the Numerical Artifact: focusSING solely on FIRST ORDER CONSIDERATIONS and acknowledgING that the observed COMPUTED nucleationS MAY BE purely numerical and should not be considered in physical terms.
    \item 
    Highlight the Numerical Artifact: Alternatively, EMPHASISING that HOMOGENEOUS SOLUTIONS SHOULD BE OBSERVABLE, DESPITE 
    THE SENSITIVITY TO numerical PARAMETERS (artifacts) (IN the quasi-Newton approach) AS WELL AS THE ABUNDANCE OF NON-PHYSICAL SOLUTIONS (IN THE NONCONVEX SCENARIO).
    \item 
    OTHERWISE.
\end{itemize}


SUGGESTING that such artifacts should be carefully interpreted, THE CONNECTION BETWEEN OBSERVABILITY AND STABILITY IS A STEP FUNCTIONAL TO UNDERSTANDING REAL COMPLEX PATTERNS THAT EMERGE, E.G., IN HIGHER DIMENSIONS OR IN OTHER DOMAINS.

In either case, our COMPUTATIONS (KE) SHOW THAT, UNLESS SECOND ORDER ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED, THE observed nucleation is not \emph{NECESSARILY} indicative of physical crackS but rather OF AN INTERPLAY BETWEEN PURELY PHISICAL PHENOMENA, INHERENT TO THE NATURE OF NATURAL PROCESSES, AND of numerical BIASES inherent to the COMPUTATIONAL methods employed. This distinction is crucial for understanding the limitations and proper application of numerical techniques AS PREDICTIVE TOOLS IN CONTEXTS WHERE CRACKS ARE A REAL CONCERN FOR STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS.

Future work will include a more detailed exploration of these algorithms and their IMPLEMENTATION for stability analysis OF APPLICATIONS IN THIN FILM FRACTURE, SUCH AS IN ARTISTIC PAINTINGS, AND FOR THE STABILITY OF THE CRYOSPHERE.

% PERFORMING AN THOROUGH characterisation of bifurcation points, conditions for stability exchange, local features of the energy landscape, qualitative features of constrained systems with respect to canonical representations of bifurcations, thorough TECHNIQUES OF energy blow up and reduction at bifurcation points.

        Energy diagram of equilibrium branches in the phase-field model of an elastic bar on stiff (left) and compliant (right) elastic foundation. In the figure, the difference $\Delta \Psi = \Psi(y_t)-\Psi_h$ between the energy of the state $y_t$ on the current branch and the homogeneous solution. Stability of solutions is indicated by colors: blue and orange indicate, respectively, stable and unstable states, by numerical evaluation of the sign of the smallest eigenvalue of the stiffness matrix $\mathbf{K}^1$. According to the local energy minimality protocol, arrows indicate the anticipated branch switching events associated with the loss of stability at load values denoted $\bar \epsilon_j, j \in \mathbb N$, where $j$ indicates the instability mode, cf. Equation~\eqref{}. Letters correspond to the states depicted in Figure XXX.%
