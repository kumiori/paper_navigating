\opening{Dear Editor,}

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, `\emph{Navigating with Stability: Local Minima, Patterns, and
Evolution in a Gradient Damage Fracture Model,}' for consideration in next issue of YYY. 

In this original article, we present an investigation of non-convex evolutionary problems with irreversibility constraints, through numerical optimisation methods for phase-field fracture models. By analysing the spectral stability properties of equilibrium paths, our finidings show that conventional solvers may fail to detect critical bifurcation points in non-convex energy landscapes. 

This offers significant insight into the effectiveness of approximate quasi-Newton algorithms, especially navigating nonconvex energy landscapes, handling constraints, and complex patterns typical of fracture evolution in thin brittle films. 

This work addresses a critical challenge in solving evolution problems in this context,  introducing a spectral analysis-based correction and a computational algorithm that ensures the stability of the computed evolution, even in the presence of irreversibility constraints. 

We trust this contribution opens new avenues in numerical fracture mechanics and nonlinear optimisation, offering tools that advance the predictive modeling of fracture mechanics.
